## New features
xNode aims to be simple and extendible, not trying to fix all of Unity's shortcomings.

If your feature aims to cover something not related to editing nodes, it generally won't be accepted. If in doubt, ask on the Discord channel.

Skim through the code and you'll get the hang of it quickly.
